<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, Josh is going to show you how to create a full-blown active directory lab on your personal computer using
VirtualBox so configuring and running this lab will definitely help your understanding of how active directory works as well as
windows networking in general I would recommend maybe running through a few times just to kind of get used to it and kind of develop that
intuition and base knowledge and then after a few times I would recommend even try building this lab we're about to do.
